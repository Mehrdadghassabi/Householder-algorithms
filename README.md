# Householder-methods
in numerical analysis <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Householder%27s_method>Householder methods</a>
are a class of <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root-finding_algorithms>root finding algorithms</a>,
with this update formula:

but there is another way to use Householder methods not using the mentioned formula!!
writing <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_series>Taylor_serie</a> of the given function with n sentences (where n denotes the number of algorithm in
the householder class) around $`x_n+1`$ with $`x_n`$ as the variable, solving it as algebraic equation would give us the update formula!!
